		You set the pace. Your vehicle makes the rest possible: with catapult-like acceleration accompanied by the powerful bass of the new, switchable AMG performance exhaust system with double tailpipe trim elements. A luxury vehicle could scarcely be more emotional. And you are sitting right in the midst of it. The new Mercedes-AMG S 63 4MATIC+ accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h in just 3.5 seconds thanks to its 450 kw (612 hp) and 900 Nm powerful AMG 4.0-liter V8 biturbo engine.

			<p class="description"> The Accent hatchback is a casualty of the redesign, as the 2018 Accent lineup in the U.S. now consists only of a four-door sedan. The car’s overall silhouette isn’t changed much, but new front- and rear-end designs give the Accent a look much like a shrunken version of the attractive Elantra sedan. The version pictured here is a top-trim Limited model, with 17-inch wheels and LED lighting accents; thrifty shoppers should be aware that the more affordable SE and SEL models look considerably less glitzy with their smaller wheels and less chrome trim.</p>
